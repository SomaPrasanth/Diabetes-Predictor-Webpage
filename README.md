🏥 Diabetes Prediction Web App
This project is a web-based application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user inputs. It consists of:
✅ Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for user interaction
✅ Backend (Node.js) for handling requests
✅ Machine Learning Model (TensorFlow) for prediction



## 🛠️ Installation & Running the Project
