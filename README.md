🏥 Diabetes Prediction Web App
This project is a web-based application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user inputs. It consists of:
✅ Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for user interaction
✅ Backend (Node.js & Flask) for handling requests
✅ Machine Learning Model (TensorFlow) for prediction



🛠️ Installation & Running the Project
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
cd diabetes-prediction
2️⃣ Install backend dependencies

Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

3️⃣ Run the servers
Start the Node.js server
node app.js
4️⃣ Open the web app
Visit index.html in your browser.

🖥️ Usage
1️⃣ Enter your medical data in the form (Age, Glucose, BMI, etc.)
2️⃣ Click Predict
3️⃣ The app sends the input to the Node.js backend, which forwards it to Flask
4️⃣ The trained model processes the data and returns the result
5️⃣ The prediction is displayed on the screen
